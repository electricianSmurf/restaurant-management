# restaurant management
It's for cafes/restaurants to take orders, manage personnel affairs. It's not a completed project yet but I wanted to share where I'm on it. I released that every time I instantiate a new object of a class, that would overload the ram and would decrease the performance of it. So I searched for it and I guess I need to apply singleton design pattern. The project seems to be changed from the outset. There's a lot of work to do. Wish me luck!
 
 Here are some sample pics from the project.
 
 LOG IN: Every staff has a password and user name. They have to log in to use the program.

PROGRAM MENU: It shows what a staff can do with the program.

STAFFS: Shows all of the staffs and It allows user to add a new staff, update a current staff and show staff entrance/exit times. I'll add an administration here. Every staff can do these things, so It's a bit useless.

TABLES: User can add(create) a new table to the restaurant/cafe by clicking the plus symbol at bottom right corner, open a new table account, take orders, update/delete orders, observe which tables are open(green) or close(red). When clicking an open table, user can list orders of the table. If there's undelivered order, program warns the user. After delivering the order user can cross it off.
